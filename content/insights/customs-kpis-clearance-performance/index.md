You cannot improve what you do not measure. Clearance performance can be tracked with a small set of KPIs that show where delays occur and how consistent your process is.

## TL;DR

- Track release time, document accuracy, and inspection rate.
- Use KPIs to identify where delays actually happen.
- Share performance data with brokers and suppliers.

## Key metrics to track

- Time from arrival to release
- Percentage of entries with document corrections
- Inspection or hold rate
- Cost per entry including storage or demurrage

## Use KPIs for process fixes

If release times spike, look for patterns by supplier, product, or port. Use the data to fix root causes instead of treating each delay as a one off event.

## Keep it simple

Start with a monthly dashboard and expand only when needed. Consistent tracking beats complex systems.
