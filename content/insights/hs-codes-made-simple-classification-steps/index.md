HS codes are the language Customs uses to decide duty rates, controls, and documentation requirements. A single digit error can shift a shipment into the wrong category and trigger questions or higher charges. A repeatable classification process keeps entries consistent.

## TL;DR

- Start with product facts and intended use before choosing an HS code.
- Use the HS structure and notes, not just a keyword search.
- When in doubt, request an advance ruling to lock in certainty.

## Start with product facts

Gather the material composition, function, level of processing, and packaging. The same item can classify differently based on use or form. A clear description is more valuable than a vague catalog name.

## Use the HS structure

The HS is organized by chapters, headings, and subheadings. Read the section and chapter notes before selecting a subheading. Those notes often determine inclusion or exclusion for specific goods.

## When to request a ruling

If a product is new, complex, or high value, request an advance ruling. It provides an official classification decision and reduces the chance of future disputes.

## Common errors to avoid

- Using old codes from a different market
- Matching by product name only
- Ignoring the material or finished state

XPS Logistics can help review classifications and build a library of consistent HS codes for your recurring imports.
