Some imports are temporary: trade show booths, professional equipment, or goods used for short term projects. In those cases, a carnet can simplify the process if the country and the goods qualify.

## TL;DR

- Temporary imports should be planned differently than regular entries.
- A carnet can streamline entry and re export for qualifying goods.
- Documentation and timelines still matter.

## When a carnet makes sense

Carnets are useful for goods that will return to the country of export. Examples include exhibition materials, tools, or professional equipment.

## Plan the timeline

Even with a carnet, you need accurate documents and coordinated logistics. Confirm eligibility and processing time early.

## Avoid common mistakes

- Missing serial numbers for equipment
- Losing track of the re export schedule
- Using the carnet for goods that will remain in country

XPS Logistics can advise on temporary import strategies and documentation planning.
