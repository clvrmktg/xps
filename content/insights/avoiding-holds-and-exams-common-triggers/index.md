Holds and exams slow down clearance and add handling costs. Many of them are preventable. The most common triggers are data inconsistencies, vague product descriptions, and missing documents.

## TL;DR

- Most holds are caused by inconsistent or incomplete data.
- Clear product descriptions reduce risk scoring.
- Fix issues before departure to avoid port delays.

## Common triggers

- Mismatch between invoice and packing list
- HS code inconsistencies across shipments
- Missing permits for controlled goods

## Fixes that work

Create a single source of truth for product descriptions and HS codes. Use a document checklist and confirm details with suppliers before cargo is loaded.

## The role of risk management

Customs risk management systems rely on data quality. Clean, consistent entries reduce the likelihood of inspections and speed release.

XPS Logistics reviews entries for consistency and can flag risk issues early.
