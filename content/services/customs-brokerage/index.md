[[faq]]
question = "How long does customs clearance take in The Bahamas?"
answer = "Clearance times can range from a few hours to 1–2 business days, depending on the type of goods, completeness of documentation, and traffic volume at the port. As your licensed broker, XPS Logistics ensures declarations are pre-filed in the Click2Clear system, enabling faster processing and minimizing delays. Air freight is typically cleared same-day; ocean freight may take longer depending on carrier schedules and cargo inspection."

[[faq]]
question = "What documents do I need to provide?"
answer = """To clear goods through Bahamian Customs using XPS as your agent, we require:

- Commercial invoice with a clear description and declared value  
- Bill of lading / airway bill listing consignee as:  
  ```
  Your Business Name  
  c/o XPS Logistics  
  Nassau, The Bahamas
  ```
  
- Packing list (if applicable)  
- Import permits or certificates for restricted goods (e.g. food, electronics, chemicals)  
- Identification or business TIN for proper declaration  

We'll review and submit these on your behalf through Click2Clear to ensure compliance and minimize the risk of penalties or inspection delays."""

[[faq]]
question = "Are there duties on personal items or gifts?"
answer = """Yes. For B2B shipments, all imported goods—regardless of whether they're gifts, samples, or promotional items—are subject to customs duty unless covered by a valid exemption or incentive.

XPS will help determine applicable duty rates and VAT based on tariff classification and declared use.

We recommend consigning shipments to:
```
Your Business Name
c/o XPS Logistics
Nassau, The Bahamas
```

This allows XPS to act as your authorized clearing agent, streamlining the brokerage process and ensuring full compliance with Bahamian import regulations."""
