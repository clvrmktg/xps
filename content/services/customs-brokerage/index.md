[[faq]]
question = "What does a customs broker do?"
answer = """A licensed customs broker represents you during the import process—submitting declarations through the **Click2Clear** system, calculating duties and VAT, arranging inspections if required, and securing release of your goods.

At **XPS Logistics**, we act as your official liaison with Bahamas Customs, ensuring your entries are accurate, compliant, and cleared as quickly as possible."""

[[faq]]
question = "How long does customs clearance take in The Bahamas?"
answer = """Customs clearance can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on shipment complexity and documentation.

**Air freight** can often be cleared the same day, while **ocean freight** may take longer—especially for consolidated or inspected cargo.

**XPS Logistics** pre-files entries in **Click2Clear** and works closely with Customs officers to ensure your goods are cleared as quickly as possible."""


[[faq]]
question = "What documents do I need to provide for customs clearance?"
answer = """To authorize XPS to clear your goods, you'll need:
- **Commercial invoice** listing item descriptions and declared values  
- **Bill of lading or airway bill**, addressed to:  
```
Your Business Name
c/o XPS Logistics
Nassau, The Bahamas
```
- **Packing list** (for multi-box shipments)  
- **Business Licence** and **Tax Compliance Certificate** (for companies)  
- **Form C-44** – Standing Authority for Declaration of Value  
- **Import permits or certificates** if your goods are regulated (e.g., food, plants, chemicals)

Once received, we review and submit everything electronically through Click2Clear for you."""

[[faq]]
question = "Are duties charged on personal items, gifts, or samples?"
answer = """Yes. All imports entering The Bahamas are subject to customs duty and VAT unless specifically exempt by law.  
Even gifts or promotional items require a proper declaration.  
XPS can help you determine the correct tariff classification and duty rate before arrival so you can budget accurately."""

[[faq]]
question = "Can international suppliers use XPS to ship to Bahamian clients?"
answer = """Absolutely. Overseas vendors can consign shipments **“c/o XPS Logistics”** when sending goods to local customers.  
We'll receive, clear, and deliver the cargo to the final consignee while the Bahamian buyer remains the importer of record.  
This arrangement simplifies logistics and ensures compliance for both parties."""

question = "How can I start the customs clearance process with XPS?"
answer = """Simply email your shipping documents—invoice, bill of lading, and any permits—to **[ops@xpslogistics.com](mailto:ops@xpslogistics.com)**.  
Our operations team will review them, confirm requirements, and guide you through the next steps.
