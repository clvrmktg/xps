In Nassau, finding secure, affordable, and available warehouse space isn't easy. With rental costs ranging from **$14.50 to over $35 per square foot**, many businesses are priced out of the space they need to operate efficiently. Whether you're a growing business or an international company looking to establish a foothold in The Bahamas, the challenge is the same: space is limited, and competition is high.

## What’s Driving the Cost?

Recent listings show warehouse spaces starting at $14.50 per sq ft, but these often come with limited amenities and additional VAT. Class A commercial facilities can push well past $25–$35 per sq ft depending on location and amenities. Availability is especially tight in areas like western New Providence, where demand from both local and international operators is increasing.

At these rates, self-managed warehousing becomes cost-prohibitive for many businesses—especially when factoring in staffing, security, and operational overhead.

## A More Cost-Effective Approach

**XPS Logistics** offers a smarter alternative: **3PL warehousing** as part of our broader logistics services.

Instead of leasing and managing your own facility, XPS handles your goods within our secure, professionally managed warehouse as part of your shipping, fulfillment, or distribution solution. This means no long-term leases, no maintenance concerns, and no capital outlay—just space that scales with your business needs.

**What you get with XPS warehousing:**

- **Prime Location** — Based in western New Providence with convenient access to major residential and commercial areas.  
- **Secure & Staffed** — Gated facility, security systems, and on-site staff during office hours.  
- **Integrated Operations** — Storage is paired with full-service logistics, including inbound freight, inventory control, and last-mile delivery.    
- **Flexible Capacity** — Scalable storage and fulfillment solutions for local businesses and international vendors alike.

## Competitive Pricing

While many warehouses in Nassau charge $14.50 to $30+ per sq. ft., XPS offers managed warehousing services at just $12 per sq. ft. — one of the most competitive rates on the island. This pricing includes not just the space, but the service that comes with it.

To ensure operational efficiency, a minimum of 100 sq. ft. is required for new warehousing clients.

## Built for Growing Demand

Our recent [warehouse expansion](/insights/xps-expands-warehouse-capacity-nassau/) doubled our footprint, allowing us to meet client needs without passing along excessive real estate costs.
