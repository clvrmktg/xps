Incoterms define who pays for freight, insurance, and clearance costs. They do not replace customs law, but they shape the documents and responsibilities that make a clean entry possible.

## TL;DR

- Incoterms define responsibility for freight and costs, not customs obligations.
- Choose terms that match your ability to manage clearance.
- Misaligned Incoterms create billing disputes and clearance delays.

## Where Incoterms affect clearance

Incoterms determine which party arranges transport and which costs are on the invoice. Those choices affect customs value and the supporting documents required for a compliant entry.

## Common pitfalls

- Using EXW without arranging export documentation
- Assigning customs clearance to a party that lacks local capability
- Mixing Incoterms with side agreements that are not reflected on invoices

## A practical selection approach

Choose terms that match operational control. If you need visibility and control at destination, consider terms that give you authority over the import process. If your supplier handles shipping, confirm that your broker still receives the right documents.
