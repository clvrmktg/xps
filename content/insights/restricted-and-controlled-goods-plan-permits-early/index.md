Some goods require permits, certificates, or agency approvals before they can be cleared. If these requirements are identified late, the shipment sits at port while documents are gathered.

## TL;DR

- Controlled goods need permits and approvals before arrival.
- Classification and product description trigger those requirements.
- Early planning prevents costly port storage.

## Identify controlled items early

Start with classification and product descriptions. If a product falls into a controlled category, you can plan for permits before the shipment leaves the supplier.

## Build lead time into procurement

Permits can take days or weeks depending on the product. Build this into ordering timelines so approvals are ready at arrival.

## Coordinate with your broker

Your broker can help confirm which products are likely to trigger controls and which agencies may be involved. That planning is far easier before the shipment ships.

XPS Logistics can review product lists and flag items that typically require special approvals.
