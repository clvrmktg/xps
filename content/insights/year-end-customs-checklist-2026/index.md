Year end is the best time to reset your customs process. A short review now prevents repeated issues in the new year and improves clearance performance.

## TL;DR

- Review HS codes, suppliers, and document accuracy before the next year.
- Update landed cost models and Incoterms if prices changed.
- Build a clearance improvement plan based on the last 12 months.

## Review classification and value

Check whether any products were reclassified or corrected during the year. Update your HS code library and valuation assumptions based on those lessons.

## Audit supplier documentation

Identify which suppliers created document issues and refresh their requirements. Consistent invoices and packing lists are the foundation of fast clearance.

## Plan improvements for 2026

Use KPIs from the year to prioritize changes. Focus on the highest cost delays first.
