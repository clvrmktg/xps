The importer of record is the party legally responsible for the customs entry. That role carries obligations beyond paying duties. It includes recordkeeping, compliance, and accuracy of declarations.

## TL;DR

- The importer of record is legally responsible for the entry.
- Accuracy and recordkeeping obligations sit with the importer, even when a broker files.
- Clear contracts with suppliers and brokers reduce exposure.

## Why the role matters

Customs relies on the importer of record to provide accurate product information, valuation, and documentation. If a shipment is misclassified or undervalued, the importer of record is accountable for corrections or penalties.

## Key responsibilities

- Maintain records and documents that support the entry
- Ensure invoices and packing lists are accurate and consistent
- Work with a broker to correct issues quickly

## Reducing risk

Assign internal ownership, create a review checklist, and confirm Incoterms so cost responsibility is clear. Even when a broker files the entry, the importer must validate the data.
