Customs value is the foundation for duty and tax calculations. It is not always the same as the price you paid on the invoice. Understanding which costs must be included helps prevent adjustments at clearance.

## TL;DR

- Customs value often starts with the transaction price, plus specific additions.
- Freight, insurance, and assists can affect the declared value.
- Clear documentation prevents valuation disputes.

## What customs value is

Most customs systems use the transaction value as the starting point, then apply defined additions when those costs are paid by the buyer. This ensures the declared value reflects the real cost of the imported goods.

## Typical additions to include

- Freight to the port of import
- Insurance when paid by the buyer
- Assists such as molds or tooling supplied by the buyer

## Documentation that supports value

Use consistent invoices, supplier contracts, and freight invoices. If the values do not reconcile, Customs may request clarification or revalue the entry.

## How XPS helps
