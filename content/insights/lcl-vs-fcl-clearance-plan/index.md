Shipment structure affects customs clearance. Less than container load (LCL) shipments involve multiple parties and more handoffs, while full container load (FCL) shipments are simpler but still require clean documentation.

## TL;DR

- LCL shipments introduce extra consolidation steps and documentation checks.
- FCL shipments reduce handoffs but still require precise data.
- Choose the mode that matches your volume and urgency.

## How LCL affects clearance

LCL cargo is consolidated with other shippers. If any shipment in the container has issues, the entire container can be delayed. That makes document accuracy critical.

## How FCL affects clearance

FCL allows more control over packing and timing, but the entry still depends on accurate invoices, packing lists, and correct classification.

## Choosing the right mode

Use LCL for smaller volumes and predictable products. Use FCL when you need control, faster release, or have consistent volume.

XPS Logistics can help you evaluate mode choice and prepare documentation for either approach.
