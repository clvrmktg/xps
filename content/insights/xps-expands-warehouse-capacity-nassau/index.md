In response to increasing demand from our expanding client base — and to serve you better — XPS Logistics has expanded its warehouse operations in Nassau.

XPS has secured new warehousing space in Nassau, doubling our capacity from 1,000 to 2,000 square feet to better support storage, staging, and fulfillment needs for both domestic and international clients. Whether you're holding inventory for inter-island distribution or preparing consolidated freight, the added space means faster processing and more predictable delivery timelines.

This move is part of our continued investment in scalable third-party logistics (3PL) infrastructure — giving clients the flexibility to grow without the overhead of managing their own warehousing or distribution.

Security and accountability remain top priorities. The warehouse is monitored 24/7 with surveillance cameras and staffed during business hours — ensuring your goods are protected and traceable at every stage.

Just as importantly, we’ve expanded without passing on the cost. While the local market averages $15–$20 per square foot, our optimized facility allows us to offer warehousing at just $10 per square foot — making scalable logistics more accessible to businesses of all sizes.

At XPS, we believe strong infrastructure is essential to strong logistics. This warehouse expansion is one of several steps we’re taking to ensure our clients always have the support they need — not just today, but as their operations grow.
