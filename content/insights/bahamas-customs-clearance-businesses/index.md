If you're importing goods into The Bahamas, customs clearance is more than just a formality — it's a critical part of your supply chain. Delays at customs can mean missed deadlines, storage fees, or frustrated customers.

**XPS Logistics** caters to both **local Bahamian businesses** and **international vendors who supply them**. Whether you're importing commercial stock, parts, or raw materials, our team ensures every shipment is properly documented, accurately declared, and cleared without delay.

As a **licensed customs broker and 3PL**, XPS handles all clearance activities through the **Click2Clear** platform — managing your shipments from arrival to final delivery, with full compliance under Bahamian Customs regulations.



## How Long Does Customs Clearance Take?

Clearance times in The Bahamas can vary depending on the size and nature of your shipment.  
A straightforward entry with complete documentation may be processed within a few hours, while more complex shipments — such as consolidated cargo or those requiring inspection — can take several days.

As your customs broker, **XPS Logistics** works proactively to shorten that window wherever possible.

Factors such as port congestion, classification accuracy, and unpaid duties can extend timelines. 

We review your paperwork in advance, file declarations electronically through **Click2Clear**, and stay in contact with Customs officers to ensure your goods are cleared and released without unnecessary delay.



## Required Documents for Customs Clearance

Each **entry** (shipment) in Click2Clear corresponds to **one Bill of Lading (B/L)** or **Airway Bill (AWB)** and all associated invoices.

To clear customs on your behalf, we'll need the following from you:

### 1. Shipping Documents
- **Bill of Lading (B/L)** or **Airway Bill (AWB)** — Acts as the shipment receipt and proof of arrival.  
- **Freight Invoice** (if freight charges are not shown on the B/L).  

### 2. Commercial Documents
- **Commercial Invoice(s)** — Lists item descriptions, unit prices, quantities, and total value.  
- **Packing List** — Required for multi-box or bulk cargo.  

### 3. Authorization
- **Form C-44** — *Standing Authority in Respect of Signing Declaration of Value* (authorizes XPS to file on your behalf).  

### 4. Business Credentials
- **Valid Business Licence** — Confirms the importer is a registered entity.  
- **Tax Compliance Certificate (TCC)** — Required by Bahamas Customs for all business imports.  

### 5. Identification
- For **Individuals** — Copy of passport or driver's licence.  
- For **Businesses** — Copy of the representative's photo ID (must match the C-44 authorization).  

### 6. Additional / Conditional Documents
Depending on the goods being imported:
- **Certificate of Origin** (for tariff preferences).  
- **Import Permits / Licences** — For restricted goods such as food, chemicals, firearms, or vehicles.  
- **Phytosanitary / Agricultural Certificates** — For plants, produce, or live animals.  
- **Insurance Certificate** — If required by Incoterms or shipment value.



## Why Use “c/o XPS Logistics” as the Consignee?

When your shipment is addressed as:

```
Your Business Name
c/o XPS Logistics
Nassau, The Bahamas
```

it means **XPS Logistics is authorized to receive or handle your goods on your behalf**, while **you remain the legal importer of record**.

### What changes:
- The shipment is **delivered to XPS** for handling and clearance.  
- XPS can **act as your broker and storage agent** under your authorization.  
- The **consignee's business licence, TCC, and C-44** are still required — ownership and tax liability remain with you.  

This format helps avoid confusion, speeds up cargo release, and ensures all communications flow through your appointed broker.

International suppliers can also consign shipments to their Bahamian customers **“c/o XPS Logistics.”**  

This ensures the cargo is received, cleared, and released to the local consignee without the supplier needing a physical presence or local licence in The Bahamas.

## How the Customs Process Works

Here's what to expect when importing with **XPS Logistics**:

### Step 1. Document Submission
You provide the commercial invoice, B/L or AWB, permits, and business credentials.  
We verify each document for accuracy before filing.

### Step 2. Entry Filing via Click2Clear
We prepare and submit your electronic declaration, including tariff classification, value, and duties.

### Step 3. Duty Payment & Clearance
Once duties and VAT are assessed, we arrange payment and coordinate release with Customs.

### Step 4. Delivery or Storage
After clearance, we deliver the goods to your location or store them at our secure Nassau warehouse.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Incorrect consignee format** — causes customs delays or queries.  
- **Under-declared values** — can lead to reassessment or penalties.  
- **Missing permits or TCC** — prevents Customs from finalizing entry.  
- **Unassigned broker** — results in longer processing and manual review.  

Our experts ensure your documentation is accurate, compliant, and ready for submission — minimizing risk and delay.



## FAQ: Bahamas Customs Clearance

**1. How long does Bahamas Customs clearance take?**  
Clearance can range from a few hours to several days depending on shipment complexity. Air freight often clears the same day, while ocean freight or consolidated cargo may take longer. XPS Logistics pre-files and monitors entries through Click2Clear to speed up the process.

**2. What documents are needed for customs clearance in The Bahamas?**  
You'll need a commercial invoice, bill of lading or airway bill, packing list, and—if you're a business—your Business Licence, Tax Compliance Certificate, and a signed C-44 authorization form. Additional permits may be required depending on your goods.

**3. What is the C-44 form and why is it important?**  
Form C-44, the *Standing Authority in Respect of Signing Declaration of Value*, allows your licensed customs broker to act on your behalf when declaring value to Bahamas Customs. Without it, your broker cannot legally file your entry.

**4. Can XPS Logistics clear shipments addressed “c/o XPS Logistics”?**  
Yes. When a shipment is sent “care of” XPS Logistics, we're authorized to receive and handle it for you, but you remain the importer of record. This setup is especially useful for international suppliers shipping goods to Bahamian clients.

**5. Are duties charged on samples, gifts, or replacement parts?**  
Yes. All imports entering The Bahamas are subject to customs duty and VAT unless specifically exempt by law. XPS can help determine the correct tariff classification and duty rate before your shipment arrives.

**6. Can XPS assist international suppliers shipping to Bahamian businesses?**  
Absolutely. We routinely coordinate imports on behalf of overseas vendors, managing documentation, Click2Clear filing, and final delivery to their Bahamian clients. Learn more about our [Freight Forwarding services](/services/freight-forwarding/) that support global shipments.

Ensure your paperwork is complete and consistent—especially invoice values, consignee details, and permits. Using a licensed customs broker like XPS ensures compliance and minimizes the risk of customs queries or re-inspection.
