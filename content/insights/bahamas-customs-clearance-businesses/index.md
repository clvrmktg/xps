If you're importing commercial goods into The Bahamas, navigating customs clearance is not just a formality—it’s a critical checkpoint in your supply chain. For small to mid-sized businesses, a delay at customs can mean missed deliveries, frustrated customers, and unexpected costs.

That’s why many Bahamian businesses trust a licensed 3PL like XPS Logistics to manage the clearance process end-to-end. As your customs broker, we ensure that your shipments move efficiently through The Bahamas Customs Click2Clear platform—accurately declared, fully compliant, and cleared on time.

## How Long Does Customs Clearance Take?

Customs clearance times in The Bahamas typically range from a few hours to two business days:

- **Air freight** can often be cleared the same day, depending on volume and documentation.
- **Ocean freight** may require one or two days, especially if cargo is consolidated or subject to inspection.

Clearance time is influenced by port congestion, classification accuracy, and whether duties are prepaid. At XPS, we pre-file documentation where possible and monitor customs responses to prevent holdups.

## What Documents Do You Need?

When importing goods through XPS Logistics, we’ll handle the electronic declaration—but we’ll need a few things from you:

- **Commercial invoice** – listing item descriptions and declared value
- **Bill of lading or airway bill** – with the consignee listed as:  
  `Your Business Name c/o XPS Logistics`
- **Packing list** – especially for multi-box or bulk cargo
- **Import permits** – required for items like food, electronics, or chemicals
- **Business identification** – including TIN or NIB number

We'll verify all documentation and ensure compliance with Bahamian tariff codes.

## Are Duties Charged on Samples or Gifts?

Yes. All commercial imports—whether purchased or gifted—are subject to duties and VAT unless specifically exempt. Bahamian customs does not offer de minimis exemptions for business shipments.

XPS will help determine the correct tariff classification and estimate duty in advance so there are no surprises upon arrival.

## Why Use "c/o XPS Logistics" as the Consignee?

Listing your shipment as:

authorizes us to act on your behalf at the border. It simplifies paperwork, avoids customs confusion, and enables us to resolve issues quickly—whether that means paying duties, handling inspections, or responding to classification queries.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Wrong consignee format** – can delay release or result in customs queries.
- **Undervalued invoices** – can trigger fines or reassessment.
- **Missing permits** – delays clearance for regulated goods.
- **No broker assigned** – individuals or unregistered importers may face longer processing.

## Import Checklist for Business Shipments

Before your shipment arrives, ensure you have:

- A complete commercial invoice
- Proper consignee format using “c/o XPS Logistics”
- Any required permits for restricted goods
- Accurate product descriptions and HS codes (we can assist)
- Business ID or TIN (for customs documentation)

<!-- ### Real-World Example: From Florida to Your Door

A local retailer recently used XPS to import a consolidated ocean freight shipment from Miami. By listing the cargo as `Retailer Name c/o XPS Logistics` and pre-clearing the documents through Click2Clear, we were able to:

- File all customs declarations before the vessel docked
- Pay duties on behalf of the client and arrange local delivery within 24 hours
- Resolve a classification dispute without the client ever visiting the port

This is the kind of logistics partnership we offer—seamless, proactive, and fully compliant. -->
