Many customs issues start at the supplier. If suppliers provide inconsistent invoices, the broker spends time fixing errors instead of clearing cargo. A clear onboarding process improves data quality from the start.

## TL;DR

- Supplier data standards prevent downstream clearance errors.
- Require consistent product descriptions and HS code proposals.
- Audit supplier documents before the first shipment.

## What to include in onboarding

Provide suppliers with a document template, preferred product naming, and required invoice fields. Confirm that packing lists match invoice descriptions.

## Validate before the first shipment

Review the supplier document set before cargo ships. Correcting errors at origin is faster than fixing them at arrival.

## Keep a feedback loop

Share issues found at clearance with suppliers so the next shipment improves.

XPS Logistics can help build supplier onboarding checklists and review first shipments.
