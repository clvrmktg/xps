[[faq]]
question = "What types of freight do you handle?"
answer = """We handle all major modes of freight, including air and ocean shipments, full-container loads (FCL), less-than-container loads (LCL), and consolidated cargo.

For vehicles, machinery, and oversized equipment, we also arrange RoRo (roll-on/roll-off) and project cargo services. Whatever you're moving, we match the best method to your cargo and timeline."""

[[faq]]
question = "Can you consolidate multiple shipments into one?"
answer = """Yes. If you're purchasing goods from different suppliers or locations, we can combine them into a single shipment. This often reduces freight costs and simplifies customs clearance, especially for smaller or mixed cargo."""

[[faq]]
question = "Can I track my shipment?"
answer = """Yes. We provide updates at every major milestone—when your cargo departs, arrives at port, clears customs, and is scheduled for final delivery. You'll always know where your shipment is and what to expect next."""

[[faq]]
question = "What documents are needed for freight forwarding?" 
answer = "To properly forward your shipment, we typically need:\n\n- A **commercial invoice**\n- A **bill of lading** or **airway bill**\n- A **packing list** (if applicable)\n- Any necessary **permits or certificates** for regulated items\n\nIf XPS is also handling your customs brokerage, we'll take care of preparing and submitting these through the Click2Clear system."

[[faq]]
question = "Do you offer port-to-door delivery?"
answer = "Yes. Once your cargo arrives and clears customs, we can deliver directly to your warehouse, store, project site, or customer—anywhere in Nassau and, through partners, throughout the Family Islands."

[[faq]]
question = "Can you forward cargo routed through the U.S. or other regions?"
answer = """Absolutely. We regularly coordinate transshipment and cross-border forwarding—moving cargo through hubs like Miami, Panama, and key Caribbean ports—when it offers better transit times or pricing. 

In simple terms, if your cargo needs to pass through another country before reaching The Bahamas, we handle the entire routing and documentation process."""
