Peak season magnifies every weak link in the clearance process. If data is late or incomplete, the queue builds quickly. Planning ahead protects lead times.

## TL;DR

- Confirm document timelines before peak season starts.
- Pre book transport and align clearance windows.
- Reduce errors by standardizing data early.

## Build a peak season calendar

Map high volume weeks and confirm supplier deadlines for invoices and packing lists. Late documents in peak season can delay the entire shipment.

## Align capacity across partners

Coordinate with carriers, brokers, and delivery partners so each handoff is ready when cargo is released.

## Prioritize accuracy

During peak season, Customs has less tolerance for rework. Clean entries keep cargo moving.
