Customs audits focus on whether entries were accurate and supported by records. Importers who can produce complete documentation reduce the risk of penalties and re assessments.

## TL;DR

- Keep organized records for every entry, including invoices and transport documents.
- Store documents in a consistent system that is easy to retrieve.
- Audit readiness lowers risk and speeds dispute resolution.

## What to keep

- Commercial invoices and packing lists
- Bills of lading or air waybills
- HS classification notes and rulings
- Proof of payment and freight charges

## Why it matters

Audits often look back months or years. A missing document can change the outcome of an audit even when the entry was otherwise correct.

## Practical recordkeeping tips

Standardize file naming, keep a digital backup, and tie documents to each entry number. Consistency matters more than fancy systems.
