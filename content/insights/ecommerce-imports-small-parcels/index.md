Small parcel imports are high volume and low tolerance for manual errors. Customs entries must be accurate at scale, which requires strong data discipline and reliable documentation.

## TL;DR

- Standardize product data for high volume parcel entries.
- Use clean SKU to HS code mappings to reduce misclassification.
- Plan for faster sorting and delivery once released.

## Data consistency at scale

When thousands of parcels move each month, the only way to maintain compliance is to standardize data. Product descriptions and HS codes must be consistent across every order.

## Documentation discipline

Ensure invoices and packing lists are generated automatically with accurate data. Mismatches between e commerce platforms and shipping documents can trigger delays.

## Plan for release and delivery

Parcel volumes move quickly after release. Coordinate last mile delivery capacity with clearance timing to avoid backlogs.
