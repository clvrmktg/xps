The fastest clearance is the one that starts before the vessel arrives. Pre arrival processing lets customs review data early, so cargo can be released quickly after arrival.

## TL;DR

- Pre arrival processing cuts dwell time when documents are complete.
- Data quality is more important than speed alone.
- Align broker, carrier, and supplier timelines before departure.

## Why early submission works

When customs has time to review entries before arrival, issues are identified earlier. That reduces last minute corrections and avoids holds after the shipment lands.

## What you need to submit early

- Final invoice and packing list
- Transport document details
- Accurate HS codes and declared values

## How to build the timeline

Ask suppliers for draft documents before sailing, then confirm final copies once the shipment is booked. Share the timeline with your broker so the entry is prepared in advance.

XPS Logistics can coordinate pre arrival submissions and align shipping schedules with clearance windows.
