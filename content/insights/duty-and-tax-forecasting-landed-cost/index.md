A landed cost model prevents pricing surprises. It helps importers understand the full cost of getting goods to market, not just the supplier price.

## TL;DR

- Landed cost includes product value, freight, insurance, duty, VAT, and fees.
- Accurate HS codes and Incoterms are the foundation of good forecasts.
- Update the model when supplier prices or freight rates change.

## Build the model

Start with the transaction value and add freight and insurance based on your Incoterms. Apply the duty rate based on HS code, then add VAT and local fees.

## Validate with actual entries

Compare the model to actual entries each quarter. This identifies classification or valuation errors and keeps pricing current.

## Use the model for purchasing

Share landed cost data with procurement and sales teams so pricing decisions are made with full cost visibility.

XPS Logistics can help create a landed cost model and validate it against entry data.
