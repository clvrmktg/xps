Compliance is a team sport. Procurement, finance, and operations all affect the data that goes into a customs entry. A simple training program improves accuracy and reduces delays.

## TL;DR

- Train teams on document accuracy and HS code basics.
- Use real examples from past entries.
- Refresh training when products or suppliers change.

## Who should be trained

Teams that touch product data, invoices, or purchasing decisions. Small errors upstream can create big clearance delays later.

## What to include

- How to describe products clearly
- How HS codes affect duty and controls
- How Incoterms impact documentation

## Keep it practical

Use checklists and real examples. The goal is fewer errors, not more theory.

XPS Logistics can provide guidance on customs documentation and compliance processes.
