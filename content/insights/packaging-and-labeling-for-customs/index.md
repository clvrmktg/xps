Packaging and labeling are part of customs compliance. If the label says one thing and the invoice says another, the entry can be delayed. Consistency reduces questions and speeds clearance.

## TL;DR

- Labels should match invoice descriptions and HS code classifications.
- Mixed cartons require clear packing lists and item level detail.
- Standard packaging rules reduce mistakes in repeat imports.

## Align labels with documents

Ensure product names, model numbers, and quantities match across labels, invoices, and packing lists. Avoid internal abbreviations that a broker or inspector will not understand.

## Handle mixed cartons carefully

Mixed cartons are common, but they require clear item level detail. Without it, Customs may not be able to confirm classification or value.

## Build packaging standards

Create a supplier guide that defines labeling and packaging requirements. This reduces rework and keeps documentation consistent.

XPS Logistics can help create packaging and labeling standards tied to your customs documentation.
