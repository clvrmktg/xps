Project cargo often arrives in phases, with oversized or specialized equipment that requires careful documentation. Clearance planning must match the project schedule to avoid delays on site.

## TL;DR

- Project cargo needs a phased clearance plan.
- Documentation should be standardized across all shipments.
- Early planning prevents bottlenecks at port and on site.

## Map the shipment phases

Break the project into shipment waves and assign documents and HS codes for each phase. This allows the broker to prepare entries in advance.

## Standardize descriptions and values

Project cargo often includes similar items shipped at different times. Use consistent descriptions and valuation methods to avoid repeat questions.

## Align clearance and delivery

Large items require specialized handling after release. Coordinate with transport partners so delivery happens immediately after clearance.
