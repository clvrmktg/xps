Customs brokerage is the work of translating a shipment into a compliant customs entry. It connects your commercial documents, product classification, and declared value to the rules that govern import clearance. When that translation is accurate, cargo moves. When it is not, delays and extra costs follow.

## TL;DR

- A broker aligns classification, value, and documents so Customs can release cargo quickly.
- Most delays come from missing data, inconsistent invoices, or unclear product descriptions.
- Importers control the inputs. Brokers make those inputs usable.

## What a broker actually does

A customs broker prepares and submits the entry, verifies the data that supports it, and coordinates with the carrier and port to release the shipment. That includes confirming the Harmonized System (HS) code, applying the correct duty and tax treatment, and matching commercial invoices to shipment details.

## Core steps in a typical entry

1. Collect documents: invoice, packing list, transport document, permits if required.
2. Classify products using HS codes and confirm any exemptions or special treatment.
3. Declare customs value and calculate duties, VAT, and fees.
4. Submit the entry and respond to any Customs questions.
5. Secure release and coordinate delivery.

## What importers control

Importers own the accuracy of product descriptions, supplier invoices, and valuations. If those inputs are vague, even a skilled broker cannot fix them quickly. Clean data before the shipment departs is the fastest way to protect lead time.
