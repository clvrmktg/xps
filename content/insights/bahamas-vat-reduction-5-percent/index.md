## TL;DR

- VAT on unprepared food sold in stores drops to 5% as of April 1, 2025.  
- Prepared foods and restaurant meals are excluded; confirm the official list and HS codes.  
- Importers should update classifications, pricing, and shipment plans to capture savings.

## What Changed

The VAT rate on unprepared food items sold in stores was reduced from 10% to 5%, effective April 1, 2025. The reduced rate applies to unprepared foods sold at grocery, convenience, and gas station stores, but not restaurant meals or prepared foods. The list of qualifying food items is defined in the amended VAT Act and related schedules. This aligns the tax change with what most households buy as basic groceries.

## What Counts as "Unprepared Food"

The official list is broad, but typical categories include:

- Fresh meats, poultry, and seafood  
- Fresh fruits and vegetables  
- Dairy and eggs  
- Grains, rice, and basic pantry staples

These categories are meant to reflect a typical food basket and are expected to cover most everyday grocery items. For exact classifications, importers should confirm the tariff lines and the VAT schedule in the amended legislation.

## What Is Excluded

The reduction does not apply to restaurants or prepared foods. Reports also note that items like sodas and candy are excluded from the unprepared food category, even when sold in stores. That distinction matters for pricing and for customs classification, especially for mixed shipments.

## Why It Matters for Trade and Logistics

Lower VAT can drive higher demand for core food items, which can lead to increased import volumes. That means:

- More frequent shipments and tighter booking windows  
- Greater sensitivity to clearance delays  
- Higher importance of correct HS codes and VAT classifications

If entries are misclassified, goods can be assessed at the wrong VAT rate or held up for review. The benefit of the tax change depends on accurate paperwork.

## What Businesses Should Do Now

1. Audit the product list you import and confirm which items fall under the 5% rate.  
2. Align with your broker to ensure HS codes and VAT schedules are correct.  
3. Update pricing files and retail systems to reflect the new rate.  
4. Plan for larger volumes if consumer demand rises.
