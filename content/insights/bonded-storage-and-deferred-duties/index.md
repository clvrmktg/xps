Bonded storage allows goods to be stored before duties and taxes are paid. It can improve cash flow and support staged distribution when demand is uncertain.

## TL;DR

- Bonded storage defers duty and tax payment until goods are released.
- It can support phased distribution and better cash flow timing.
- Compliance and accurate records are essential.

## When it can help

If you import seasonal goods or large volumes that will sell over time, bonded storage can align duty payments with actual sales.

## What to plan for

Bonded storage still requires accurate documentation, inventory control, and clear release procedures. Errors can create compliance risk.

## Align with your broker

Your broker should manage the entry process and ensure goods are released correctly when needed.

XPS Logistics can help evaluate whether bonded storage fits your import program.
