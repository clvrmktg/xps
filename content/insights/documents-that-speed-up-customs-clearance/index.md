Most clearance delays are document delays. If the commercial data does not match the transport data, entries slow down. A tight document package makes clearance predictable.

## TL;DR

- Standardize invoices, packing lists, and transport documents.
- Align product descriptions across every document.
- Submit complete data before the shipment arrives.

## The must have documents

- Commercial invoice with consistent descriptions and values
- Packing list that matches cartons, weights, and counts
- Bill of lading or air waybill with correct shipper and consignee details
- Any permits or licenses for controlled goods

## Data consistency matters

Customs compares fields across documents. If the invoice shows one product description and the packing list shows another, the entry is flagged for review. Use one product naming convention across all documents.

## Pre shipment checklist

Create a checklist that is completed before cargo departs. This reduces the need for last minute corrections and supports pre arrival processing where available.

XPS Logistics can help you build a document template set and review supplier compliance before each shipment.
