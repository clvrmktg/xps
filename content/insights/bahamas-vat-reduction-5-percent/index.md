Effective **April 1st, 2025**, the Government of The Bahamas has reduced Value Added Tax (**VAT**) to **5%** on a wide range of **unprepared food items**.

This policy change impacts both importers and consumers, covering everything from meats and seafood to fresh produce, dairy, grains, and everyday staples.

## What's Included

The official VAT-approved list is extensive, but in summary the reduced rate applies to:

- **Meats & Seafood**: beef, pork, lamb, goat, poultry, fish, shellfish, and other fresh or frozen animal products  
- **Dairy**: milk, yogurt, cheese, butter, cream  
- **Fruits & Vegetables**: potatoes, onions, tomatoes, leafy greens, bananas, mangoes, citrus fruits, apples, melons, berries  
- **Staples & Grains**: rice, flour, cereals, legumes (beans, peas, lentils), nuts, cassava, sweet potatoes  
- **Other Foodstuffs**: sugar, coffee, tea, spices, honey, cocoa, pasta, bread, and more  

This means that most core items in the Bahamian food basket now benefit from the reduced VAT rate.


## Why It Matters

- **For Importers & Retailers**: Lower VAT provides room to adjust margins or pass savings directly to consumers.  
- **For Consumers**: A direct easing of grocery costs at a time when food inflation has been a concern.  
- **For Trade & Logistics**: With more goods moving under the reduced VAT category, it's crucial that tariff codes are properly classified to ensure compliance and maximize savings.
