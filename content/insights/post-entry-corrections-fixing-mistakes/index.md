Even well managed imports sometimes require corrections. The key is to act quickly and document the change. Waiting can create compliance risk and expose you to penalties.

## TL;DR

- Identify errors quickly and correct them with documentation.
- Maintain a log of changes for audit readiness.
- Use a broker to manage corrections and communicate with Customs.

## Common reasons for corrections

- Incorrect HS code or duty rate
- Quantity or value discrepancies
- Missing documentation discovered after release

## A simple correction workflow

1. Identify the error and gather supporting documents.
2. Notify your broker and prepare a correction request.
3. Keep a record of the correction and outcome.

## Prevent repeat errors

Use post entry reviews to improve supplier documentation and internal processes. A small adjustment in data capture can prevent future corrections.
