Classification disputes create uncertainty and slow down repeat imports. Advance rulings provide clarity and reduce the chance of reclassification when goods arrive.

## TL;DR

- Advance rulings provide written decisions on classification.
- They reduce disputes and help standardize entries.
- Use them for new or complex products.

## When to seek a ruling

If a product is new to your import program or has multiple possible HS codes, an advance ruling gives a clear answer and protects future shipments.

## Benefits beyond compliance

Advance rulings improve pricing accuracy and inventory planning because duty and tax treatment becomes predictable.

## How to prepare

Provide detailed product descriptions, technical data, and intended use. The better the description, the faster the decision.

XPS Logistics can help assemble the documentation needed for a strong ruling request.
