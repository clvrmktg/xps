Perishable goods have little tolerance for delays. Customs clearance must be fast, documents must be correct, and delivery must be coordinated to preserve product quality.

## TL;DR

- Pre arrival submission and accurate documents are critical for perishables.
- Cold chain continuity depends on fast release and quick delivery.
- Small errors can create large losses when shelf life is short.

## Build a tight pre arrival process

Submit complete documents before arrival so Customs can review early. This reduces the time cargo waits on the dock.

## Document precision matters more

Perishables are often inspected more closely. Use clear descriptions, correct HS codes, and accurate weights to avoid review delays.

## Coordinate release to delivery

The clearance plan should include immediate pickup and delivery. The fewer handoffs, the better.
