A customs broker is a long term partner in your supply chain. Selecting the right one affects clearance speed, compliance, and cost control. The right questions up front prevent expensive surprises later.

## TL;DR

- Look for accuracy, responsiveness, and local capability.
- Ask about classification processes and document review.
- Make sure the broker can scale with your volume.

## Questions to ask

- How do you validate HS codes and values?
- What is your standard document checklist?
- How quickly do you respond to Customs queries?
- Do you handle exceptions and post entry corrections?

## Fit matters as much as price

A low fee does not help if it leads to delays or penalties. Evaluate a broker based on process quality and the ability to communicate clearly.

## Build a trial period

Start with a smaller shipment and evaluate performance. Track clearance time, responsiveness, and accuracy before committing long term.
